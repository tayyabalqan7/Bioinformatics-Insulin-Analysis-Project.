Student ID: CA/SE1/6617

Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive bioinformatics study of Human Insulin (P01308), completed as part of a four-task academic assessment.

Key Findings
Homology Search (Task 1): Utilized NCBI BLASTp to identify 100% sequence identity between human insulin and primate orthologs, confirming extreme evolutionary conservation.

Multiple Sequence Alignment (Task 2): Performed MSA via Clustal Omega across 5 species (Human, Chimp, Dog, Pig, and Zebrafish).

Structural Conservation: Identified 100% conservation of the six Cysteine residues necessary for disulfide bond formation, proving the structural framework of insulin has remained unchanged for 450 million years.

Database Study (Task 4): A 5-6 page comparative report on the integration of NCBI, UniProt, and PDB in protein research.
